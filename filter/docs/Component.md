### 🚀 **Why does registering `@Component` solve the problem?
The `@Component` is an annotation that causes Spring to register the class as a “bean”.  
Spring will throw an error if the bean is not registered because it cannot be injected via `@Autowired`.

---.

## 📌 **1. If `@Component` is not registered**.
#### ❌ **Problem situation**
```java
public class OpenAPIInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {
    // ...
}
```
✅ **In this case, `OpenAPIInterceptor` is just a Java class, not an object managed by Spring.  
✅ So when we try to inject it using `@Autowired`, we get the error **“No beans of type ‘OpenAPIInterceptor’ found”**.

```java
@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
    @Autowired
    private OpenAPIInterceptor openAPIInterceptor; // ❌ Here's the problem! Can't inject because it's not a bean

    @Override
    public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
        registry.addInterceptor(openAPIInterceptor)
                .addPathPatterns(“/**”);
    }
}
```
✅ **If Spring doesn't know about `OpenAPIInterceptor`, it can't inject it.**

---]

## 📌 **2. If you registered an `@Component`**
#### ✅ **Solution code**
```java
@Component
public class OpenAPIInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {
    // ...
}
```
✅ By appending `@Component`, Spring automatically registers this class as a bean.  
✅ Now we can inject `OpenAPIInterceptor` with `@Autowired`.

```java
@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
    @Autowired
    private OpenAPIInterceptor openAPIInterceptor; // ✅ Injected correctly!

    @Override
    public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
        registry.addInterceptor(openAPIInterceptor)
                .addPathPatterns(“/**”);
    }
}
````

## 🔥 **Recap: Difference between registering `@Component` and not registering it**.
| Situation | Description | Result |
|------|------|------|
| `@Component` **None** | Just a regular Java class, not managed by Spring | Can't be injected with `@Autowired` (error `No beans found`) |
| `@Component` **Does exist** | Registered as a bean, managed by Spring | Injectable with `@Autowired`, can be used by other beans |

✔ **Conclusion:**  
Registering an `@Component` **makes it an object (Bean) that Spring automatically manages**,  
👉 If you don't register it, it's just a regular Java object and can't be injected into `@Autowired'** 🚀.
